        // We first need to create a new PixiJS application instance
        const app = new PIXI.Application();

        // Now we need to call an asyncronous method on our PixiJS 
        // application called "init" which initializes our display
        // using a defined width and height measured in pixels.
        await app.init({

            backgroundColor: "#3398b9",
            width: 800,

        // Now all we need to do is to tell PixiJS what HTMLElement
        // in our DOM we want to show our game using a DOM helper
        document.getElementById('game').appendChild(app.canvas);

        // First lets create ourselves a new graphic instance to 
        // represent our "cirlce" on the screen and assign it to 
        // a variable called "circle"
        const circle = new PIXI.Graphics()

        // Now we can set it's "fill" color to a nice fun yellow!
        circle.beginFill("#f5ef42")

        // Now we need to tell Pixi to draw an actual circle 
        // the three arguments we need are: X, Y, and radius size
        // all measured in pixels. So this cirlce will start at 
        // zero X and zero Y coordinates with a 5 pixel radius
        circle.drawCircle(5, 5, 5)

        // Now we need to call an end to our "fill" that we started 
        // earlier with our "beginFill" call with the "endFill" call
        circle.endFill()

        // Now we need to tell our circle where to "spawn" on our 
        // game display by setting it's "view" x and y coordinates
        circle.x = 450
        circle.y = 400

        // This will determine our circle's "velocity" and direction
        let xv = 1
        let yv = 1

        // Now finally!!! Let's add our cirlce to our game stage 
        // to see what happens using the addChild call
        app.stage.addChild(circle)

        // Now what we need to do is to add a refresh engine that 
        // powers our graphic's movement. We can use Pixi's built
        // in "ticker" feature like so...
        app.ticker.add(() => {
            // All of the following code will be executed on every
            // "frame" update/refresh
            // If our circle exceeds 800px or is less than zero
            if (circle.x >= 800 || circle.x <= 0) {
                // This will flip a postitive number to a negative
                // as well as a negative to a positive due to the 
                // "math of signs" property in mathematics which 
                // states two negatives equals a positive
                xv = -xv
